//Array 

//Arrays are written in square brackets [], we can write both number and string value as well as mixed datatype.

const myArr = [1,2,3,4,6]
const myHeros = ["Ironman","thor"]

console.log(myArr[1])
console.log(myHeros[0])

//Array Method

myArr.push(7)
console.log(myArr);

// PUSH method use to add a datatype into the exisiting array

myArr.pop()
console.log(myArr)

// POP method use to remove last data from the end of datatype

myArr.unshift(9)
console.log(myArr)

// Unshift method add your argunment in the starting od thr Array. But it not good for large amount of dataset

myArr.shift()
console.log(myArr)

// Shift method remove 0th index from the array. You do not need to pass any argunment

// console.log(myArr.includes(9));
// console.log(myArr.indexof(3));

// These are question method, which we can use to ask JS about the argunment

const newArr = myArr.join()
console.log(myArr)
console.log(newArr)

// JOIN method is use to convert number to string datatype



//Slice  and Splice

// The slice() method of Array instances returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object selected from start to end (end not included) where start and end represent the index of items in that array. The original array will not be modified.

let slicearray = ["Spring","Ai","DeepSeek","Chatgpt","Gemini","claude"]
console.log(slicearray.slice(2))
console.log(slicearray.slice(2,4))

// In first onemptied, the result would start from index number 2 and it will end to last index
// In second  onemptied, the result would start from index number 2 and it will end to index number 4
