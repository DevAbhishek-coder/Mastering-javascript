//Array 

//Arrays are written in square brackets [], we can write both number and string value as well as mixed datatype.

const myArr = [1,2,3,4,6]
const myHeros = ["Ironman","thor"]

console.log(myArr[1])
console.log(myHeros[0])

//Array Method

myArr.push(7)
console.log(myArr);

// PUSH method use to add a datatype into the exisiting array

myArr.pop()
console.log(myArr)

// POP method use to remove last data from the end of datatype

myArr.unshift(9)
console.log(myArr)

// Unshift method add your argunment in the starting od thr Array. But it not good for large amount of dataset

myArr.shift()
console.log(myArr)

// Shift method remove 0th index from the array. You do not need to pass any argunment

// console.log(myArr.includes(9));
// console.log(myArr.indexof(3));

// These are question method, which we can use to ask JS about the argunment

const newArr = myArr.join()
console.log(myArr)
console.log(newArr)

// JOIN method is use to convert number to string datatype



//Slice  and Splice
